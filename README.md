# YeelightRGB-juce
Juce Static Lib for communicating with Yeelight RGB bulbs

YeelightRGB-juce is a library for communicating with Yeelight RGB Bulbs. It supports the full communication API as specified
by Yeelight, but does not support the discovery protocol, i.e you need to find the bulb's IP address via other means.

An example VST/AU/Standalone plugin is included allowing control of the light's brightness and color via MIDI/DAW automation.

Released under GPL v3.0 license. This is required by JUCE licensing terms.
